# Personal Bussines Card 

## What is it?

This project is an answer for a challenge given in the Coursera Scrimba React course.

## Tools Used

I used React + Vite to build this page.

## How to Run

Step 1: Clone the repository to your local machine.
Step 2: Open the cloned repository in your terminal.
Step 3: Run the following command to install the necessary dependencies (make sure you have npm package manager installed):

```npm install```



Step 4: After the installation is complete, run the following command to start the development server:

```npm run dev```



After completing the above steps, the page will be accessible on port 5173.

Please note that the code and instructions provided assume the use of npm as the package manager. If you are using Yarn, you can replace the npm commands with the equivalent yarn commands.
